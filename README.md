# The aim of the project is to compare selected relational databases and selected frameworks enabling access to the database using Java. The project aims to examine the effectiveness of the configuration of individual databases and frameworks using a query test of various complexities and difficulties. The result will be the query execution time for different sized data sets. We compare the obtained times, present them in charts and draw conclusions.
